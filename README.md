# purescript-aff-retry

(Purescript port of Haskell's [retry](https://github.com/Soostone/retry) package)

[API docs on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-aff-retry/)

Monadic action combinators that add delayed-retry functionality, potentially with exponential-backoff, to arbitrary actions.

The main purpose of this package is to make it easy to work reliably with `MonadAff` actions that often fail. Common examples are database queries and large file uploads.

### Example usage

```purescript

import Prelude

import Effect.Aff (Aff, Milliseconds(..))
import Effect.Console (log)
import Effect.Class (liftEffect)
import Effect.Aff.Retry ( RetryPolicyM
                               , constantDelay
                               , defaultRetryStatus
                               , limitRetries
                               , recovering
                               )


someAction :: Aff Unit
someAction = liftEffect $ log "Potentially failing action"

recoveredAction :: Aff Unit
recoveredAction = recovering myRetryPolicy checks someAction
  where
    myRetryPolicy :: RetryPolicyM Aff
    myRetryPolicy = constantDelay (Milliseconds 200.0) <> limitRetries 10

    checks :: Array (RetryStatus -> Error -> Aff Boolean)
    checks = [\(RetryStatus { iterNumber: n }) -> error -> pure true ]

```
